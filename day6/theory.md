## 🔐 Module Privacy & Encapsulation in Rust

### ✅ Key Concepts

- **Private by default**: All functions, structs, and modules in Rust are private unless explicitly marked `pub`.
- **`mod` boundaries enforce encapsulation**: Code outside a module cannot access its private contents.
- **No runtime access**: Rust has no reflection or introspection, so private values and functions cannot be inspected or called externally at runtime.

---

### 🔍 Case Study: `get_secret_recipe()`

```rust
mod sausage_factory {
    fn get_secret_recipe() -> String {
        String::from("Ginger")
    }

    pub fn make_sausage() {
        get_secret_recipe();
        println!("sausage!");
    }
}
```

- `get_secret_recipe()` is private and **cannot be accessed outside** the module
- The function is used internally, but its return value is not exposed (not printed or returned)
- Even `unsafe` code can't access it unless it’s made `pub`

---

### 🔒 Is It Safe?

Yes — **as long as the function remains private** and its output is not leaked through a public interface (e.g., returned, logged, or printed), the data is secure and inaccessible from outside the module.

Rust's strict compile-time checks prevent accidental exposure of internal logic or values.

---

### 🧠 Why It Matters

- Keeps internal logic encapsulated
- Protects secrets (e.g. keys, logic, constants)
- Enables clean, minimal public APIs

This is especially important in **blockchain**, **cryptography**, or **library development**, where **leaking internal values could lead to real exploits**.

Great! Let's break this one down clearly and explain **what's missing**, **why it matters**, and **how `use` and `as` work** in this context.

---

## 🔍 **Problem Summary**

You're trying to print two snack constants in `main()`:

```rust
println!(
    "favorite snacks: {} and {}",
    delicious_snacks::fruit,
    delicious_snacks::veggie,
);
```

But the compiler complains: `fruit` and `veggie` don't exist!

That's because they're **not defined at the module level**. You’re expected to use `use` and `as` to **bring internal constants into scope** and rename them.

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

### 🔹 Inside `mod delicious_snacks`, add:

```rust
use self::fruits::PEAR as fruit;
use self::veggies::CUCUMBER as veggie;
```

Now you're:
- Bringing `PEAR` from the `fruits` module into scope
- Renaming it to `fruit`
- Doing the same with `CUCUMBER`, renamed to `veggie`

---

## ✅ Final Working Version

```rust
mod delicious_snacks {
    // Bringing internal constants into module scope with new names
    pub use self::fruits::PEAR as fruit;
    pub use self::veggies::CUCUMBER as veggie;

    mod fruits {
        pub const PEAR: &str = "Pear";
        pub const APPLE: &str = "Apple";
    }

    mod veggies {
        pub const CUCUMBER: &str = "Cucumber";
        pub const CARROT: &str = "Carrot";
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!(
        "favorite snacks: {} and {}",
        delicious_snacks::fruit,
        delicious_snacks::veggie,
    );
}
```

### 🧪 Output:
```
favorite snacks: Pear and Cucumber
```

## 🧠 Theory Behind `use` and `as`

| Keyword | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `use`  | Brings a module item into scope (e.g., constants, types, functions) |
| `as`   | Renames the item when it's brought in — great for clarity or name conflicts |

### ✅ Why This Is Useful

- Helps **clean up long paths**  
  Instead of `delicious_snacks::fruits::PEAR`, you can just say `fruit`
- Avoids name clashes if two modules export the same name (e.g. `APPLE` from `fruits` and `veggies`)
- Improves code readability and modularity

---

## 🔒 Bonus: Why `pub use`?

In our case, `fruit` and `veggie` are accessed from `main()`, **outside** the `delicious_snacks` module.

So we need to make them **public** using `pub use`, or else `main()` will get a visibility error.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Usage Example |
|--------|----------------|
| Bring in and rename   | `use self::fruits::PEAR as fruit;` |
| Make it public outside module | `pub use ...` |
| Access renamed item   | `delicious_snacks::fruit` |

This is a common pattern in libraries where internal items are re-exported under friendly names.

---

## 🔹 Module Path Aliasing with `use` and `as`

### ✅ Concept

Rust allows you to **bring items into scope** from nested modules using the `use` keyword. You can also **rename** them using `as`.

This is useful for:
- Avoiding long paths
- Making code more readable
- Preventing name conflicts

---

### 🧪 Example:

```rust
mod delicious_snacks {
    pub use self::fruits::PEAR as fruit;
    pub use self::veggies::CUCUMBER as veggie;

    mod fruits {
        pub const PEAR: &str = "Pear";
        pub const APPLE: &str = "Apple";
    }

    mod veggies {
        pub const CUCUMBER: &str = "Cucumber";
        pub const CARROT: &str = "Carrot";
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!(
        "favorite snacks: {} and {}",
        delicious_snacks::fruit,
        delicious_snacks::veggie,
    );
}
```

---

### 💡 Why It Works

- `use self::fruits::PEAR as fruit;`  
  → Brings `PEAR` into the module scope and renames it `fruit`
- `pub use` makes it accessible **outside the module**
- In `main()`, you can now use `delicious_snacks::fruit` directly

---

### ✅ Summary Table

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `use path::to::item` | Brings item into local scope |
| `as new_name` | Renames the item for clarity |
| `pub use` | Re-exports item for outside access |
