# Day 8 – Move Semantics, Borrowing, and State

## ✅ Rustlings
- [x] move_semantics1
- [x] move_semantics2
- [x] move_semantics3
- [x] move_semantics4
- [x] move_semantics5

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Moved values cannot be reused unless cloned
- Borrowing lets you pass data without giving it up
- Mutable references (`&mut`) change values in-place safely
- Rust enforces exclusive access rules at compile time

## 🛠️ Next Up
- Begin integrating `contract-cli` interface with commands:
  - `deposit`, `withdraw`, `status`, `history`
- Use `&mut` for modifying balance efficiently
- CLI will tie theory to real tool development
